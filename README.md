# Introduction to JDBC #
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that enables Java applications to interact with relational databases. It provides a standard interface for connecting to a database, executing SQL queries, and retrieving results. JDBC is part of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) and serves as a critical component for building database-driven applications in Java.
## Key Features of JDBC ##
__1. Database Independence:__

JDBC allows Java applications to work with any relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.) using the appropriate database driver.

__2. Platform Independence:__

As part of Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy, JDBC works seamlessly across different operating systems.

__3. Standardized API:__

JDBC provides a uniform interface for database operations, such as querying, updating, and managing data.

__4. Support for SQL:__

JDBC enables the execution of SQL commands, including DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), and DCL (Data Control Language).

## How JDBC Works ##
JDBC uses a driver-based architecture to interact with databases. The process involves the following steps:

__1. Load the JDBC Driver:__

A JDBC driver acts as a bridge between the Java application and the database.

__2. Establish a Connection:__

The application connects to the database using a Connection object.

__3. Execute SQL Queries:__

SQL commands are sent to the database using Statement or PreparedStatement objects.

__4. Retrieve Results:__

Results from queries are accessed using the ResultSet object.

__5. Close the Connection:__

Properly closing the database connection ensures efficient resource management.

## Common JDBC Classes and Interfaces ##

__1. DriverManager:__ Manages the database drivers.

__2. Connection:__ Represents a connection to the database.

__3. Statement:__ Used to execute SQL queries.

__4. PreparedStatement:__ A subclass of Statement that allows parameterized queries.

__5. ResultSet:__ Holds data retrieved from the database.

## Advantages of JDBC ##
1. Database independence.
2. Simplified application development.
3. Integration with other Java technologies, such as Servlets and JSP.
4. Secure and efficient database interactions using Prepared Statements.
